The Logic: Deconstructing the 194% Growth
In this analysis, the **194% Growth** represents the extra money earned on top of the previous year's base.

Base Year (100%): $1,000,000
Growth Amount (194%): $1,940,000 (New Revenue)
Total Revenue (294% of Base): $2,940,000

Key Insight: Volume vs. Price
To ensure the growth was healthy, I analyzed the **Price Variance**. 
While revenue grew by **194%**, the Average Unit Price only increased by **3.8%**. This proves the growth was driven by **market demand and volume (+183.3%)**, not just price inflation.
