The Logic: Deconstructing the 194% Growth in 2023

In this analysis, the 194% Growthrepresents the extra money earned on top of the previous year's base.

Base Year (100%): $1,000,000
Growth Amount (194%): $1,940,000 (New Revenue)
Total Revenue (294% of Base): $2,940,000

Key Insight:

-To ensure the growth was healthy, I analyzed the Price Variance. 
-While revenue grew by 194%, the Average Unit Price only increased by 3.8%. This proves the growth was driven by market demand and volume (+183.3%), not just price inflation. We saw significant growth across revenue and quantity sold. However, increased in revenue is directly associated with increase in quantity. 
-Time series analysis of the monthly sales trend identifies seasonal performance dips in Q3 (June–August) might be a combination of summer sasonality(in Dubai, June–August is also "Summer Season" where many expats leave for holidays.) and out of stock situation.
-Customer acquisition increased by 135% in the customers growth rate means, the business earned 1.35 x more than the previous year's base. The customer's base increased 2.34x the original customer's base.
